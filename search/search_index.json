When each time the user asks a question, the previous embedding is replaced with embeddings pulled from the current question, this reduces token usage significantly Static embeddings are applied in front of each user message and get stored with the conversation instead of being replaced with each question. Hybrid embeddings are a combination, with the first embedding being stored in the conversation and the rest being dynamic, this saves a bit on token usage. User embeddings are injected into the beginning of the prompt as the first user message. Dynamic embeddings are helpful for Q&A, but not so much for chat when you need to retain the context pulled from the embeddings. The hybrid method is a good middle ground Usage: <@1275521742961508432>assistant embedmethod assistant mention Description: Toggle whether to ping the user on replies Usage: <@1275521742961508432>assistant mention assistant model Description: Set the OpenAI model to use NOTE Specifying a model without it's identifier (like gpt-3.5-turbo instead of gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 ) will sometimes lose the ability to call functions in parallel for some reason, this is an OpenAI issue.

If the target satisfies the conditions, only the heatpoint related actions will be carried on. The heatpoint actions will be \"sandboxed\", so the newly added heatpoints won't have any effect outside this test. Remember that Warden evaluates each condition in order and stops at the first failed root condition: the last condition that is listed in a failed rule is where Warden stopped evaluating them. If a valid Rank is also passed it will be used in place of the target's real rank during the test. See the documentation for a full list of Warden events.
